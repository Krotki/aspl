## ASPL executable and bytecode infrastructure
The AIL backend of the ASPL compiler outputs bytecode instead of native code (in contrast to the C backend, which ultimately compiles to native code using a C compiler); this has the following advantages:

* Generating bytecode is faster than generating native code
* The bytecode is easier to read and debug
* The bytecode is platform independent
* Writing and maintaining a bytecode compiler is easier than writing and maintaining a native compiler
* ...

On the other hand, the bytecode is obviously not an executable and requires an interpreter to run.

Most bytecode languages, such as Java, require that all programs written and compiled in that language have an interpreter (or a virtual machine) installed on the system on which they are executed.

ASPL takes a different approach and bundles the whole runtime, including the bytecode interpreter, into a single binary and finally adds the bytecode generated by the compiler as a resource to the executable. This executable can then be shipped, distributed, and executed on any system just like a native executable without any dependencies.

## Templating
Since compiling the runtime can take quite some time and may require additional dependencies, the runtime is compiled only once into a so called "template" and then shipped together with the compiler in every distribution.

That way, compiling ASPL programs into executables is as simple as copying the template and adding the bytecode as a resource, which has the following advantages:

* Faster compilation of ASPL programs
* No additional compile-time dependencies
* Seamless cross-compilation
* ...

The templates in this folder are automatically generated by a CD script and updated whenever the ASPL installation is updated using `aspl update`.
